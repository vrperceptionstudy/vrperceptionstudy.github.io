Thank you for your interest in our study. We are a group of researchers at the University of Toronto in Canada, trying to understand how humans perceive size and depth in Virtual Reality. We need your help to run a study for this task. In order to participate, you need to have access to any sixâ€“degree of freedom VR device compatible with Windows (such as Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Valve Index, or Windows Mixed Reality devices) or an Oculus Quest.

### Alright, what do I have to do?

Running the study is extremely simple and quick! We expect that it will take around 15 to 20 minutes for the whole process. Here's how you can participate:

1. Go to [https://forms.gle/kwzdXaeA1Zb3UQSn8](https://forms.gle/kwzdXaeA1Zb3UQSn8). All the other steps are accessed through this form.
2. Watch a short (2min 30sec) instructions video to understand the tasks.
3. Download a lightweight application to your Windows computer or Oculus Quest.
4. **[For Oculus Quest users only.]** You can either use your Quest in [Link mode](https://www.oculus.com/blog/play-rift-content-on-quest-with-oculus-link-available-now-in-beta/) as a standard Windows device (recommended), or you need to [enable developer mode](https://uploadvr.com/how-to-sideload-apps-oculus-go/) on it.
5. Run the study. It should take about 15 minutes.
6. Finish the short (_actually_ short, we promise) survey in the form in (1).

### That's cool and all, but what's in it for me?

Glad you asked. Here's a list of benefits.

1. You get to test your size and depth perception ability in VR! A score given at the end of the study tells you how well you did.
2. You get a **US $5** amazon.com (or equivalent, based on your preference) gift card.
3. We are keeping a **leaderboard** over [here](https://dgp.toronto.edu/~arorar/leaderboard.htm). If you get a high score and are among the **top ten** at the end of the study, we will send you an additional gift card worth **US $15**.
4. After the study concludes (exact date to be announced), we will send you a **detailed report of your performance**. So you can know exactly how you performed at each task!
5. You get our immense gratitude and the satisfaction of having helped science.

### Is that all?

Almost. If you _really_ like the study, or _really_ want that top ten spot, you can repeat the experiment up to 2 more times. Only the best score counts, so each repetition will give you a chance to improve your score. But that's not all: each repitition will also give you **100 bonus points**.

So, you score is computed is:

| Session  | Score for session  | Total score                                             |
| ---      | ---                | ---                                                     |
| 1        | S<sub>1</sub>      | S<sub>1</sub>                                           |
| 2        | S<sub>2</sub>      | max(S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>) + 100                 |
| 3        | S<sub>3</sub>      | max(S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>, S<sub>3</sub>) + 200  |
